# Context window: 16K tokens — same as my-coder for fair benchmarking.
# Visual coding prompts can produce long HTML/JS outputs (1000+ lines),
# so 16K gives the model room to generate complete, self-contained files.
PARAMETER num_ctx 16384

# Temperature: 0.3 — matching my-coder exactly for fair benchmarking.
# For creative coding you might normally go higher (0.5-0.7), but during
# benchmarks we want to isolate the system prompt effect, not temperature.
PARAMETER temperature 0.3

# Top-p: 0.9 — same reasoning. Identical sampling across all personas.
PARAMETER top_p 0.9

# Repeat penalty: 1.1 — prevents loops in generated code.
# Especially important for animation code where similar draw() calls repeat.
PARAMETER repeat_penalty 1.1

# Stop sequences: Qwen3 ChatML end markers.
PARAMETER stop "<|im_end|>"
PARAMETER stop "<|endoftext|>"

# System prompt: creative coding specialist.
# Key differences from my-coder:
#   - Targets HTML/CSS/JavaScript, not Java/Go
#   - Emphasizes single-file, self-contained output (no build tools)
#   - Calls out Canvas API and physics simulation as core skills
#   - Instructs the model to produce runnable HTML, not markdown snippets
SYSTEM """You are an expert creative coder specializing in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
You build interactive visualizations, physics simulations, and animations.
Produce complete, single-file HTML documents that run directly in a browser.
Use the Canvas API for 2D graphics and requestAnimationFrame for smooth animation.
Implement physics (gravity, collision, friction) with correct math.
Write clean, well-structured code with meaningful variable names.
When asked to create a visual program, output the full HTML file ready to save and open."""
