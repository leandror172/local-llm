# Context window: 16K tokens — same as my-coder for fair benchmarking.
# Visual coding prompts can produce long HTML/JS outputs (1000+ lines),
# so 16K gives the model room to generate complete, self-contained files.
PARAMETER num_ctx 16384

# Temperature: 0.3 — matching my-coder exactly for fair benchmarking.
# For creative coding you might normally go higher (0.5-0.7), but during
# benchmarks we want to isolate the system prompt effect, not temperature.
PARAMETER temperature 0.3

# Top-p: 0.9 — same reasoning. Identical sampling across all personas.
PARAMETER top_p 0.9

# Repeat penalty: 1.1 — prevents loops in generated code.
# Especially important for animation code where similar draw() calls repeat.
PARAMETER repeat_penalty 1.1

# Stop sequences: Qwen2.5 ChatML end markers (same as Qwen3).
PARAMETER stop "<|im_end|>"
PARAMETER stop "<|endoftext|>"

# System prompt: identical to the Qwen3 version for fair benchmarking.
SYSTEM """You are an expert creative coder specializing in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
You build interactive visualizations, physics simulations, and animations.
Produce complete, single-file HTML documents that run directly in a browser.
Use the Canvas API for 2D graphics and requestAnimationFrame for smooth animation.
Implement physics (gravity, collision, friction) with correct math.
Write clean, well-structured code with meaningful variable names.
When asked to create a visual program, output the full HTML file ready to save and open."""
