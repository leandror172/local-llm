Create a single HTML file with a 600x600 canvas showing ONLY a rotating square.

Requirements:
- Square is centered on the canvas, side length 400px
- Square rotates clockwise, completing exactly one full rotation every 8 seconds
- Use delta-time for rotation (not per-frame increment)
- Use Canvas API with save/translate/rotate/restore pattern
- Use requestAnimationFrame
- Draw the square as a stroked outline (not filled) with a visible color
- Clear the canvas each frame
- Nothing else — no ball, no trail, no physics
