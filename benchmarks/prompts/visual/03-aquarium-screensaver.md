Create a single HTML file with an animated aquarium screensaver:
- A fish tank that fills the full browser window with a blue gradient background (darker at the bottom)
- At least 8 fish of varying sizes swimming in both directions
- Fish should be drawn procedurally (no images) with a body, tail fin, and eye
- Each fish has a slightly different color and swimming speed
- Fish smoothly turn around when reaching the tank edges
- Bubbles rise from the bottom at random positions, growing slightly as they ascend, and pop when they reach the surface
- Seaweed/plants at the bottom that gently sway side to side
- A sandy bottom with small pebbles
- Subtle light rays from the top that shimmer
- Use the Canvas API for rendering
- Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animation
- The animation should run indefinitely as a screensaver
