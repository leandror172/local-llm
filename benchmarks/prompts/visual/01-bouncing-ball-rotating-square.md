Create a single HTML file with the following 2D physics simulation:
- A ball forever bounces off the interior walls of a square without the effect of gravity
- The square is slowly rotating in a clockwise direction, completing one full rotation every 8 seconds
- The ball should never leave the inside of the square
- The ball should have a visible trail showing its recent path
- Use the Canvas API for rendering
- The canvas should be at least 600x600 pixels
- Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animation
