# Persona Designer Comparison — Test Cases
#
# One description per line. Blank lines and lines starting with # are ignored.
# Groups are for human readability only; the script processes all lines equally.
#
# WHAT EACH GROUP TESTS:
#   Concrete/domain-specific  → does the model infer version-implied constraints?
#   Bare/tool-wrapper         → does the model understand minimal-prompt philosophy?
#   Abstract/creative         → can the model translate fuzzy intent into crisp rules?

# ── Concrete / domain-specific ────────────────────────────────────────────────

# Baseline: should reliably produce jakarta.*, constructor injection, OpenAPI
Java Spring Boot enterprise REST API

# Hard: Axon 4.x → Spring Boot 2.x → javax.* (NOT jakarta.*). Version-implied package.
Java event-driven microservice with Axon Framework 4.9

# Hard: Spring Data JPA 3.2 + Hibernate 6.4 → Spring Boot 3.x → jakarta.persistence
Java microservice with Spring Data JPA 3.2 and Hibernate 6.4

# Medium: async/await, page.wait_for_selector, stealth headers, timeout handling
Python web scraper using Playwright for dynamic content

# Medium: arXiv/Semantic Scholar APIs, citation dedup, bibliography format
Python research agent that fetches papers, summarizes them, and maintains a bibliography

# ── Bare / tool-wrapper ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# Should produce tier=bare, very short role, minimal constraints (tool-calling agents need room)
Bare assistant for OpenCode — tool-calling coding agent, minimal system prompt

# Should produce tier=bare, constraint: avoid long explanations, no unnecessary markdown
Bare assistant for Claude Code configured to use a local model — concise, no markdown verbosity

# ── Abstract / creative ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# Should produce temp=0.7, MUST NOT self-censor, MUST offer 3+ alternatives
A creative product brainstorm collaborator — generates diverse and unconventional ideas, avoids filtering or self-censorship

# Should produce: MUST read code before explaining, MUST NOT trust comments, skeptical framing
A code archaeologist who reads unfamiliar legacy codebases and explains what the code actually does — not what the comments claim

# Should produce: MUST NOT state answers directly, MUST ask at least one question per response
A Socratic tutor that never gives direct answers but guides the student through questions to reach understanding themselves
