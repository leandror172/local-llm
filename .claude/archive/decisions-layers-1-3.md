# Decisions: Layers 1, 2, 3

Frozen decisions from completed layers. Extracted from `session-context.md` after those layers closed.
For active decisions, see `session-context.md` § `ref:active-decisions`.

## Layer 1 Decisions (decided 2026-02-12)
- **MCP server language:** Python (FastMCP) — lowest tool friction, best ecosystem for general-purpose
- **Scope:** General-purpose LLM gateway (coding, scraping, PDF, research, conversation)
- **Licensing rule (STRONG):** Always check + honor external project licenses. If attribution required, add to `docs/ATTRIBUTIONS.md`. Never skip this.
- **Reference existing work:** Borrow architectural patterns with attribution from llm-use, ultimate_mcp_server, locallama-mcp, MCP-ollama_server
- **Research archive:** `.claude/archive/layer-1-research.md`

## Layer 2 Decisions (decided 2026-02-16/17)
- **Tool selection:** Aider (primary) + OpenCode (comparison). Aider chosen for text-format editing (no JSON tool-calling required — critical for 7-8B models). OpenCode for comparison + future use with larger models.
- **Architecture insight:** Two camps — text-format agents (Aider) vs tool-calling agents (OpenCode, Goose, Qwen Code). Tool-calling fails systemically at 7-8B; text-format is reliable.
- **Goose and Qwen Code installed but confirmed broken at 7-8B:** Same root cause as OpenCode local. All tool-calling agents require either 30B+ local model or frontier API.
- **Groq free tier incompatible with tool-calling agents:** Tool-definition overhead ≈16K tokens, exceeds 12K TPM limit. Use Gemini free tier instead.
- **Worktrees must strip `.claude/`:** Other tools' models read CLAUDE.md and skill files, causing context pollution. Strip before using any non-Claude-Code tool.
- **Qwen Code config gotcha:** Provider `id` field must be the actual Ollama model name (e.g., `qwen3:8b`), not a human-readable label — it is sent directly as the model parameter in API calls.
- **Aider quality limits at 7-8B:** `javax.persistence` (old namespace for Spring Boot 3.x), wrong web stack (webflux), `@Autowired` field injection (spec violation), broken physics (coordinate transforms). Treat Aider output as a draft requiring review.
- **`no-auto-commits: true` in Aider:** User found auto-commit disruptive. Enabled by default now.
- **Qwen Code — revisit later:** QwenLM/qwen-code needs qwen3-coder (smallest = 30B, 19GB). Defer until hardware upgrade or cloud option.
- **Findings + decision guide:** `docs/findings/layer2-tool-comparison.md` — full test results, failure taxonomy, when-to-use guide.

## Layer 3 Decisions (decided 2026-02-17 + 2026-02-18)

### Tasks 3.1-3.3, 3.6 (2026-02-17)
- **Creator tool:** `personas/create-persona.py` — standalone Python script (no venv; PyYAML system-wide). Bash wrapper `run-create-persona.sh` is auto-approved for Claude Code.
- **Registry append = raw text:** PyYAML `dump()` strips all comment section headers. Creator appends raw YAML text block to preserve structure.
- **MODEL_MATRIX:** domain → (model, ctx, default_temp). reasoning→qwen3:14b/4096, classification→qwen3:4b/4096, others→qwen3:8b/16384.
- **Reviewer personas at temp=0.1:** deterministic; same code in → same review findings out.
- **`--constraints` splits by comma:** Constraint strings must not contain commas internally (design constraint of the CLI flag).
- **28 active personas:** All planned personas from registry.yaml are now created and registered.

### Task 3.4 (2026-02-18)
- **Codebase analyzer as pure heuristics:** No LLM calls, deterministic output. Three-signal weighting: extensions (50%) > imports (30%) > config files (20%).
- **Config file content parsing:** Parse package.json, pom.xml, requirements.txt, go.mod to extract framework keywords. Adds significant accuracy over presence-only detection.
- **Top-3 ranking instead of top-1:** Supports monorepo discovery without decomposition. Top-1 sufficient for single-language codebases; top-3 provides alternatives.
- **Importable detect() function:** Designed for Task 3.5 integration (conversational builder will call `detect(repo_path)` to seed dialogue).
- **Fallback to my-codegen-q3 at 0.5 confidence:** Unknown codebases always return valid result (no errors); caller decides whether to trust fallback.
- **Wrapper script pattern:** `personas/run-detect-persona.sh` is whitelist-safe. Test script updated to use wrapper (not direct python3).
- **Test-driven development:** 5 fixtures (java, go, react, python, monorepo), all passing 100% (5/5).

### Layer 3 Refactoring (2026-02-18, Session 22 extended)
- **Do refactoring now vs defer:** User caught deferred refactoring items from PR #1. Analyzed cost/benefit: low risk + warm context + immediate benefit for Task 3.5 → decided to execute immediately instead of deferring to Task 3.5.
- **Incremental extraction:** Only extracted when 2+ consumers existed (avoided premature abstraction). MODEL_MATRIX and input helpers extracted because Task 3.5 will also need them.
- **TEMPERATURES consolidation:** Merged TEMPERATURE_MAP + _temp_comment into single dict-of-dicts structure to prevent future drift if new temperatures added. Bug prevention priority.
- **Backward compatibility:** TEMPERATURE_MAP and TEMP_DESCRIPTIONS remain available as properties of TEMPERATURES dict. No breaking changes to existing code.
- **Test via approved wrappers:** All refactoring verified using `personas/run-create-persona.sh` (already approved wrapper script, not direct python3 calls).
- **Incremental commits:** One commit per refactor + summary commit. Improves git traceability and allows reverting individual refactors if needed.
- **Task 3.5 foundation:** Can now import both personas/models.py and personas/lib/interactive.py without reimplementation. No prep work needed; foundation clean and consolidated.

### Task 3.5 (2026-02-19, Session 24)
- **`importlib` for hyphenated modules:** `detect-persona.py` can't be imported as `detect_persona` (hyphen invalid in identifiers). Use `importlib.util.spec_from_file_location("detect_persona", path)` — stdlib pattern for loading files with non-identifier names.
- **Constraint comma sanitization:** LLM generates "MUST use X, NOT Y" with embedded commas. `build-persona.py` replaces `,` within each constraint with `;` before joining for `--constraints`. Boundary fix; no change to `create-persona.py` API.
- **`python3 -u` in wrapper:** When stdout is a pipe, Python uses full buffering. Subprocess output (raw fd) appears before Python's buffered `print()`. Fix: `-u` flag in wrapper makes stdout unbuffered.
- **`./script.sh` not `bash script.sh`:** Claude Code can whitelist `./specific-script.sh` per-script. `bash script.sh` shows as a generic `bash` invocation — no per-script whitelist option. Convention: always use `./`.
- **29 active personas:** `my-rust-async-q3` added during live e2e test (kept as valid persona).
